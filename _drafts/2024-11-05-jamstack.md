title: What is jamstack?
---

In the process of making this website and learning docs-as-code, I keep coming across this idea of using static site generators like Jekyll.
There was a popular comparison site, [StaticGen](staticgen.com)[1], which has since been redirected towards [Jamstack](jamstack.org).
I've always been curious at what jamstack meant.

It wasn't until I came across [Cloudflare's article on what a static site generator is](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/) that the section on JAMstack did it __click__.
Jamstack's own [glossary page](https://jamstack.org/glossary/jamstack/) was light on details.
It started out as "JAM stack" because it was an acronym for Javascript, API, and Markup.

__Markup.__ A markup language like hypertext markup language (HTML), but increasingly it has been Markdown that generates HTML.

__Javascript.__ Use the browser, instead of the server, to provide the interactive elements.

__API.__ An abstraction from the backend server so web development happens all on the frontend.



This is a reversion to how sites used to be. I remember a programming class in middle school when I was learning HTML that there was a program called Dreamweaver.

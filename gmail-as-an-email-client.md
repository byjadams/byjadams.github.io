Gmail as an email client
========================

We are all used to using our webmail portals to access one account. I log into [Yahoo!](https://mail.yahoo.com/) to see my Yahoo! emails. I log into [Gmail](https://gmail.com/) to see my Gmail emails. A little known feature of Gmail is the ability to sign into other emails using the webportal! This feature is found in the *Accounts* tab in your settings under [Send mail as](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/22370?hl=en).
